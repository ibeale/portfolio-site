# Portfolio Site

A modern portfolio website built with Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
